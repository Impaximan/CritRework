Update 1.5.0.0
-Added "Special" prefixes, which are prefixes exclusive to weapons with certain critical strike conditions
-[b]This means over 80 new prefixes[/b]
-Prosthetic Arm can no longer have cooldown-based crit conditions
-Reduced critical strike damage of the sniper rifle to account for all of the accessory additions that have been made since the mod's release (still very powerful)
