Update 1.5.0.0
New additions:
-Added Fire in a Bottle, a new accessory which can be found deep underground
-Added the whetstone extractor, a new utility item always sold by Skeleton Merchants
-Added "basic" whetstones, which are now found underground in chests instead of iron/lead whetstones
-Added 6 new vanity accessories which allow you to customize the sounds made by critical strikes
-Added "Special" prefixes, which are prefixes exclusive to weapons with certain critical strike conditions
-[b]This means over 80 new prefixes[/b]
-Added "icon_small"

Balance changes:
-Prosthetic Arm can no longer have cooldown-based crit conditions
-Reduced drop rates of Noxious Eye, Rabid Claw, and Sparking Sludge
-Reworked "Critically strikes if the projectile has been travelling for more than 1 second" slightly
-Crystal shield now has a 10 second cooldown after taking damage
-Reduced critical strike damage of the sniper rifle to account for all of the accessory additions that have been made since the mod's release (still very powerful)
-Reduced crit damage of shadowbeam staff
-Adaptive crit condition lasts for longer but has a slightly lower damage multiplier
-Reduced Amarok crit damage and time to crit

Removals:
-Removed "low inspiration" crit condition (it was uninteresting imo. If I can figure out how it'll eventually be replaced with something more interesting for bard)
